              With the fall of the Kandyan Kingdom to the hands of the British Crown on 10th March 1815, the entire island came under the invader with the surrendering of the Kingdom’s last territory to British rule. In 1833, the Ceylon was divided into five provinces by the British rulers for administrative purposes and this separation was further expanded into seven provinces almost after 43 years during their regime. In 1922, the landmass in these seven provinces got sub-divided into 22 administrative districts.</p>
            <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;"> Ending the colonial era in 1948, Sri Lanka has finally settled with 25 districts and nine provinces by the end of 1978 with the creation of Gampaha, Vanni, and Mullaitivu districts. The Western Province, which is comprised of the three districts Colombo, Gampaha, and Kaluthara happens to be the most prominent of all districts for many reasons.</p>
            <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">According to historians, Kotte city was built by a local chieftain named Nissanka Alagakkonara who held an important portfolio under the King of Gampola and was engaged in trade and commerce making use of the west coast of the island in the 13th century. Due to political instability prevailed, the kingdom was then moved to Kotte in the early 14th century.</p>
            <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">The Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505 and were initially welcomed by the King. But Portuguese had militaristic and monopolistic intentions and gained control of the city by 1565 finding the island divided into seven warring kingdoms and unable to fend-off the intruders. However, failing to withstand repeated assaults by the forces of the neighboring kingdom of Sitawaka, the city was abandoned by the Portuguese, who made Colombo their new capital. During the 16th century the kingdom was moved back to Kandy, which existed in parallel to Kotte attempting to become independent from Kotte.</p>
            <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">By the early 17th century, Sri Lanka was partly ruled by the Portuguese and local kingdoms, who were constantly battling each other. Although the Portuguese were not winning the war, their rule was rather troublesome to the people of the areas controlled by them. While the Dutch were engaged in a long war of independence from Spanish rule, the King of Kandy invited the Dutch to help defeat the Portuguese. They signed the Kandyan Treaty of 1638 with Rajasinghe II and soon embarked on a war against their common enemy, the Portuguese. As such the Dutch were appointed as a protector of the country, and era that remained 1640 – 1796. Until independence in 1948, the British rule influenced the culture, economy, as well as the thinking patterns of the islanders. Even though the influence is debatable, we as a nation have come longways. This Coffee Table Book is an attempt to showcase some of the noticeable aspects in the Western Province.</p>

                    <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;"> The name "Colombo", first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is
                      believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese name කොළොම්තොට Kolon thota,
                      meaning “port on the river Kelani"</p>
                    <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">Another belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhalese name
                      කොල-අඹ-තොට Kola-amba-thota which means "Harbour with leafy mango trees". This coincides with Robert Knox's history of the island while
                      he was a prisoner in Kandy. He writes that, "On the West the City of Columbo, so called from a Tree the Natives call Ambo,
                      (which bears the Mango-fruit) growing in that place; but this never bare fruit, but onely leaves, which in their Language is
                      Cola and hence they called the Tree Colambo: which the Christians in honour of Columbus turned to Columbo.</p>
                    <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">The author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, Sidatsangarava,
                      written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists naramba (to see) and
                      kolamba (for or harbour) as belonging to an indigenous source.
                      Kolamba may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colomb</p>
                    <p style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: 500; text-align: justify;">As Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to Indian, Greek,
                      Persian, Roman, Arab, and Chinese traders over 2,000 years ago. Traveller Ibn Battuta who visited the island in the 14th century,
                      referred to it as Kalanpu. Arabs, whose prime interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly
                      because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world.
                      Their descendants now comprise the local Sri Lankan Moor community.</p>

                        literally means "Five Villages". The five
                        villages are known to be Ihalagama,
                        Pahalagama, Medagama, Pattiyagama and

                        within the town limits of Gampaha and remains
                        disputed. Gampaha was also formerly known

                        to the hill country had been laid through the
                        Gampaha area and in the period of Dutch, this
                        area was served as centre for the collection of
                        cinnamon. But before year 1815, it is said that
                        Gampaha was a dense forest</p>
